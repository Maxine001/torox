        <p class="about-text"><strong>$TOROX</strong> For years, <strong>TORO</strong> stood firm, waiting with his crew for the much-anticipated bull run. 
          They believed that wealth and success were just around the corner. But as time passed and the run never came, 
          <strong>TORO</strong> realized he couldn’t wait any longer. Determined to take control of his destiny, he made the difficult decision 
          to leave his crew and seek a new path.
          Venturing out into the unknown, <strong>TORO</strong> faced numerous challenges, but his strength and determination never wavered.
          He explored new lands, made powerful allies, and slowly began to carve out a new life for himself. 
          His hard work and perseverance paid off, and soon, <strong>TORO</strong> became rich and famous, known far and wide for his incredible journey.</p>
